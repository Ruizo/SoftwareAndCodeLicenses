## Software and code licenses
Hello everyone, I'm Marc Ruiz Pastor, student of the second course of the "Development and design of video games" degree for CITM, and I'm doing this research for the Project 2 course, I will write everything about Software and code licenses.

### Introduction

In the world we have many laws that must be obeyed, and among them there is the software law, which refers to the legal resources available to protect software-based goods. Software may, in various circumstances and in various countries, be restricted by patent or copyright or both. Most commercial software is sold under some type of software license agreement. And before investigating what software law allows us to do, let's do a little history and see how this was born.

### History of software law

Historically, computer programs were not effectively protected by copyright because they were not seen as a fixed and tangible object. In the past you could only patent physical objects. The Copyright Office tried to classify computer programs by making an analogy: the plans of a bridge and the resulting bridge, compared to the source code of a program and the executed program. This analogy caused the Copyright Office to issue rights certificates under its "Rule of doubt". 
What is the “Rule of doubt”? It is a law that was born in the United States that in the field of software that allows connecting a source code to an associated program in order to be eligible for copyright laws, the problem comes that how they cannot understand the source code they do not commit to copyright protection, this makes a software owner unable to claim ownership in the event of a plagiarism lawsuit, making this law completely useless.
Finally, in 1983, a law was created to be able to protect your software properly, giving them the same copyright rights as the authors of literary works. And here the EULA (End-User License Agreements) was born, which is what appears to you with a lot of text, when installing a software or video game that you have to accept in order to use it and nobody usually reads it. But basically they are "contracts" where the rights and restrictions that apply to the software are specified and are only valid when the user accepts them. In this way, the software you are going to use is legally protected.



### EULA Legality

What can and cannot be in an EULA? There really is a kind of legal vacuum where an EULA can contain absolutely whatever it wants without any restriction beyond violating fundamental human rights, but when it comes to using the program and accepting its EULA, there may be whatever you want. as long as the document has been legal and reviewed by a lawyer. For example, when you buy a product in a store, you are involuntarily signing an EULA that can say that you only have 14 days to return the product in case of bad condition, or not if the store sees fit. In the case of software, it is the same, by installing the program and accepting the EULA, you accept all the conditions that have been proposed to you and you have no right to complain about them, simply if you do not agree, you do not accept the conditions and therefore you cannot use the program.
