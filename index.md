## Software and code licenses
Hello everyone, I'm Marc Ruiz Pastor, student of the second course of the "Development and design of video games" degree for CITM, and I'm doing this research for the Project 2 course, I will write everything about Software and code licenses.

### Introduction

In the world we have many laws that must be obeyed, and among them there is the software law, which refers to the legal resources available to protect software-based goods. Software may, in various circumstances and in various countries, be restricted by patent or copyright or both. Most commercial software is sold under some type of software license agreement. And before investigating what software law allows us to do, let's do a little history and see how this was born.

### History of software law

Historically, computer programs were not effectively protected by copyright because they were not seen as a fixed and tangible object. In the past you could only patent physical objects. The Copyright Office tried to classify computer programs by making an analogy: the plans of a bridge and the resulting bridge, compared to the source code of a program and the executed program. This analogy caused the Copyright Office to issue rights certificates under its "Rule of doubt". 

What is the “Rule of doubt”? It is a law that was born in the United States that in the field of software that allows connecting a source code to an associated program in order to be eligible for copyright laws, the problem comes that how they cannot understand the source code they do not commit to copyright protection, this makes a software owner unable to claim ownership in the event of a plagiarism lawsuit, making this law completely useless.

Finally, in 1983, a law was created to be able to protect your software properly, giving them the same copyright rights as the authors of literary works. And here the EULA (End-User License Agreements) was born, which is what appears to you with a lot of text, when installing a software or video game that you have to accept in order to use it and nobody usually reads it. But basically they are "contracts" where the rights and restrictions that apply to the software are specified and are only valid when the user accepts them. In this way, the software you are going to use is legally protected.



### EULA Legality

![EULA](https://networkencyclopedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/eula-example.png)

What can and cannot be in an EULA? An EULA can contain absolutely whatever it wants without any restriction beyond violating fundamental human rights, but when it comes to using the program and accepting its EULA, there may be whatever you want. as long as the document has been legal and reviewed by a lawyer. For example, when you buy a product in a store, you are involuntarily signing an EULA that can say that you only have 14 days to return the product in case of bad condition, or not if the store sees fit. In the case of software, it is the same, by installing the program and accepting the EULA, you accept all the conditions that have been proposed to you and you have no right to complain about them, simply if you do not agree, you do not accept the conditions and therefore you cannot use the program.

### Video game legal aspects and digital vs physical video games

When we talk about video games, we must have different things to take into account in legal matters, first, we must know what an Intellectual Property or IP is. The simplest definition of IP is any creation of the human mind, be it inventions, literature, art, designs, logos, names, images, etc. Any creation by a human person that did not exist until now can be considered as IP.

![IP](https://static.thenounproject.com/png/2732689-200.png)

But of course, not everything works, you can't go to the park, take some sand and herbs and say that you have invented sand soup, it must have a useful design, and although it can be derived from other products, it must be original. IPs are protected by various laws depending on the type they are, in this case we will focus on IPs related to the world of video games, video games are protected by copyright laws which we will talk about later.
For a few years, there has always been an eternal debate in the world of video games about whether it is better to have a physical copy or a digital copy, in the end everyone has their tastes and may prefer one or the other, but I'm going to get into the legal issue and act as the devil's advocate so that you can see the differences between one and the other.

When a person buys a video game online, they are not really buying the game literally, they are buying a license for one-person use, which does not guarantee any security over the years, for example, if you have bought a video game on the Wii Shop old, today you cannot download that video game since there is no such store and you, by accepting the store's EULA, have probably accepted that if the store closes at some point, the amount of the video games purchased will not be refunded to you, nor will they right to release you after closing.

On the other hand, when you buy a physical video game, you are buying more than a video game license, you have it tangible, you can leave it to your friends and you can even sell it second-hand, unless the video game has explicitly written otherwise, it usually happens with promotional or press products. Of course, video game companies are much more interested in the digital issue, not only because of the cost of making physical copies and distributing them around the world while online they can sell them with a click, if not how there is no resale of digital copy video games, you won't lose money from a copy that has been sold at a thrift store. In fairness, the topic of digital sales is much more attractive and economical for a video game developer company.

## Copyright and trademark rights

### About Copyright

A common question that novice developers have is, how do I protect the rights of my game? Do I have to register it somewhere so it won't be stolen? Is it legal for me to copy it if I don't put the phrase "all rights reserved"? We will discover all this in a moment, but it must be clarified that copyright laws are not the same in all countries, so I will tell you what we know about copyright in Spain and I will compare it with a country like the United States.

![Copy](https://como-funciona.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/c%C3%B3mo-funciona-el-copyright-800x400.jpg)

Copyright is the right to use the implementation of an idea, beware, the implementation of an idea, not an idea in abstract form, ideas cannot be owned. What does this mean in practice? That you can make a game like the one we are developing, a turn-based rpg in project 2 classroom, where there is some new mechanic that you want to implement and a story written by us, that is an implemented idea (in the case that the video game has been finished), however Thinking about making a turn-based rpg video game with new mechanics and a story made by you, is an idea and therefore, since it is not implemented, you cannot patent it or have copyright on it, an idea has to be real.

### How is copyright created?

How are copyright rights created? You have them automatically when you make that idea come true, you don't have to do anything else. There is only one problem, and that is that in the event that someone copies you, you have to be able to show that it is not you who has copied from that person, how do you achieve that? Easy, showing your work publicly so that it is recorded that you did it first. And if you are doing a secret project and suddenly you see someone who has done the same thing as you, but has taken it out before, then bad luck for you, although if you have had it in secret and nobody knew about it, how do you have you been copied?
I want to make a point saying that the playable mechanics are not protected by copyright, you can make a game that is exactly the same as Dark Souls as long as the graphics, music and level design are not the same.

### How long does copyright last?

How long does copyright last? Between 50 and 100 years after the death of the author depending on the country, in Spain for example it is 70 years. After that period, the work becomes public domain, which means that it has no rights and anyone can do whatever they want with it. For example the mythical work of "Moby Dick" has no copyright and if you want to put the book in your video game, make a video game about the book or whatever, you are free to do it without restrictions. If you think that the duration of copyright is exaggerated, it is because it is, this was not born that way because it was the most logical, it is a term that began being much shorter but was lengthened by pressure from long companies, particularly Disney who did not want to lose the rights to Mickey Mouse.

Can someone else's copyright be infringed for a free product, for example by having Super Mario appear in a video game I made? The answer is no, the only difference between charging for the video game and making it free, is that if Nintendo claims it from you being the free video game, the only thing they would tell you is to withdraw the video game (at least until the character is eliminated) and if it is a game that has been sold, they would report you and claim all the money earned from the sales of the video game.

### Conclusion and Creative Commons

![CC](https://www.pikaramagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Reconocimiento-no-comercial-sin-obra-derivada.png)

In conclusion, you have copyright from the beginning and you do not have to do anything to defend it beyond being able to demonstrate that you are indeed the author.

There are also free licenses, which is a way to completely or partially renounce your copyright, the best known is "Creative Commons" that allows you to apply some rules so that people can freely use your work, for example, make people not be able to earn money through your work or you can earn money as long as you put your name on the credits or directly waive all your rights and conditions, etc.

## Trademark

### What is a trademark?

Apart from copyright we have trademark registrations, such as names and logos. For example, we have the rights to the video games that we are creating, but we do not have the rights to the brand of the video games that we are making, that is, let's say that our video game is called “School Project”, you put it on sale and everything is perfect, but if you don't trademark “School Project”, anyone could do a “School Project 2” and you won't be able to do anything about it.

### Protecting your brand

What if someone came and registered the trademark "School Project" if I don't have it registered? Should I rename my own game? When you are going to register a trademark, you not only look to see if that trademark is already registered, but also if it is in use, and if someone is already using it, at first they will not let you register it, and yes, I say at first because with good enough lawyers you can get anything, if for example Disney wanted the brand name "School Project", it would probably get it and you would be forced to change the name of your game.

When registering a trademark not only is taken letter by letter, if not, if it looks like another trademark enough to cause confusion, if I have the “School Project” trademark and you want to register the “School Project” trademark, you probably won't leave, at least not if it is for video games, because that is another, the brands are registered by class. 

### Trademark classes

![Classes](https://i.ibb.co/qkzf9YV/Trademark-class-list-in-india.jpg)

When registering a brand, you will focus on registering it on the products in which you plan to use it, for example, video games, clothes and toys in case you want to sell merchandising. But if later a brand of sausage wants to release the "School Project" sausages, it can do so because you do not have the brand registered for food. But can you register the mark in all existing classes? The answer is that you can, but each class will have an additional cost and also in certain countries like the United States, you cannot register a trademark if you do not show that you are really using it for that class. And that's another, the trademark registration goes by country, and how many more countries you want to register your product, more money it costs.

### How much does it cost to register a trademark?

Registering a trademark for a single class and a single country can cost you around € 100, and worldwide around € 3000. Then you have to renew it every 10 years, if not, you lose it. If you want to register a trademark in Spain, you can do it yourself through the internet, through the website of the Electronic Headquarters of the Spanish Patent and Trademark Office. But if you want to register it in the United States, it has to be done by a lawyer who works there and they will charge you a lot of money, including the trademark filing and the private lawyer's money. In the United States they consider that if your video game is not on sale yet, you are not using the brand, so you have to renew it by paying $ 500 every 6 months and you have a maximum of 3 years to release the video game and if not, you lose it. Once you have a brand, you also have to worry about protecting it so as not to lose it, that is why sometimes there are companies that denounce others who have released a game with a similar title even though the game has nothing to do with it, but they usually don't. To bad, if not because if they do not defend their brand it is possible that they end up losing control over it.

So if you are an indie studio should you register your studio name or the title of your games? At first no, you should make sure that the names you choose are original enough so that they do not currently exist and nobody can think of something similar, but in theory nobody is going to take away your brand unless that brand is worth a lot of money. When your business starts to grow serious and you have a game that is successful enough to know that they are going to try to copy or try to cheat the name by making similar products, then you should start looking at this point.

### Can you mention a trademark in your videogame?

Something that you can do and that is legal in the world of brands, is only to mention other brands for your video game without going any further, that is, in your game you can make an NPC that says "My favorite game is Fortnite", although Fortnite is a registered trademark, you are neither saying that this brand is yours, nor are you using it as a product, nor are you implying that Fortnite is affiliated with you, etc. You are simply mentioning the Fortnite brand and that is legal, the only thing you would do is give it more publicity.

### Non-disclosure agreement and patents

There are also other types of license, such as trade secrets or patents. In the case of trade secrets, it is usually accompanied by a document called Non-disclosure agreement (NDA), which has been reviewed by lawyers and acts in a similar way to an EULA since you must sign it, where it says that you cannot tell anything about it. videogame in development or copying anything from it, you also face very high fines if you break this agreement. And in the case of the patent, it is the complete opposite of copyright, the patent protects an idea that has not yet been conceived, the problem is that it is subject to several conditions such as, for example: it must have some new aspect (to the industry being manufactured), it does not have to exist today and it has to be useful. In the case of video games, they cannot be patented since the only thing that changes is the way they are played, but for example if a new console or virtual reality device were invented, it could be patented there.

### Copyright and trademark symbology

©:

The “C” for copyright is used to show who has the rights to the product and is usually accompanied by the year in which the work was first published. Do you have to use it in your video game? No, is it any use? Neither. The only time it can be useful is when it's unclear whose product is and you want to demonstrate it. For example, if you hire a Publisher and they advertise the video game, because it is known that the rights are yours, or in a video game like Smash Bros, they have to clarify that several of the characters that appear are not the property of Nintendo.

®:

The “R” for trademark is placed in the upper right corner of trademarks or logos that are officially registered. Do you have to use it? In principle no, it does not have to, but this is something that varies a bit depending on the countries because there are some countries in which, if you do not use it, and then someone copies it and you go to court, this person could declare that you do not I knew the brand was yours. So if you put the little "R" once somewhere in your video game or website, you already have more than enough to claim the opposite, but it is not mandatory.

™:

Finally, the "TM" which stands for Trade Mark, is used to indicate that what is next to the name that appears is not an officially registered trademark, yet, but you consider it your trademark, it has absolutely no validity legal, it is just a way of saying that even if it is not registered because that brand is yours.

## Software license and code/assets licenses

### Free software licenses

In the field of software licenses we have 2 very different categories, first we have those that are free and open, and then there are those that are not free.

In the section of free ones there are: those in the public domain, which are exempt from any restriction, anyone can use the software freely without fear of any type of infringement. Then there are permissive licenses, which is very similar to those in the public domain, but with minimal restrictions, such as putting the name of the company that created the software in your final product. We also have the protective licenses or also called Copyleft, these offer you the use of the program freely, but the original authors reserve the right to modify it, share updates, use licenses or even share the software, for example, if at any time they do not want you to use the program anymore, they are within their right to do so.

![Soft](https://i.imgur.com/2riEY7I.png)

 ### Non-Free Software Licenses
 
Then there is the block of non-free licenses, in them we have: non-commercial licenses, these types of licenses mean that the person who uses the software cannot earn money through it, thus leaving only for its standard use. There are also proprietary licenses, which are usually those used by the copyright system, where the full rights of the software are held by its developers, the vast majority of products use this type of license. And finally, as I have mentioned previously, there are trade secrets, where no information can be offered to the public and a document must be signed according to some restrictions.

![Soft2](https://i.imgur.com/EbaJF7J.png)

### Code/Assets licenses

Now we move on to code / asset licenses, as with video games, everything that one creates from code either for personal use or to share in the future, is automatically subject to copyright law and its author is the the only one who has the right to modify the original source code unless it is clearly written otherwise in a license file. If you use a third-party program to make your asset or code, make sure that the program lets you share it freely. For example, if you make a game for Unity and it reaches X sales, you have to give a percentage of the sales to Unity, the same can happen with other software.

For example, raylib has a license that allows you to freely use and modify the source code only on the condition that if the source code of raylib has been modified, it must be well marked that it has been modified and does not represent the original software.

![Raylib](https://i.imgur.com/Vx6vUUP.png)

### What do I need to write in my license?

Each person is free to put their own conditions to be able to use their original software or assets, you can add any condition that you see fit, you can put it for payment (as long as the software where they have been made allows it) or you can make them completely free and that the other people do what they want as they please. It is very important to create an informative document with the type of license you are creating and the conditions that you impose on your own code or asset, in the event that there is NO type of document on licenses, people will not have the right to modify anything in the original software and they must explicitly contact the author to write them a message saying what they can and cannot do with their software or asset, or due to copyright laws the original author could report such people who have modified the code without their permission.

### Software vs code/assets license

So how does the software license compare to the code or asset license? Actually, there is not much difference between the two, in the end both the software and the code are ideas that have arisen from the idea of a person and the restrictions that one wants to put on it are completely made by that person, perhaps a software usually has more conditions in the license since they are normally programs made for personal or commercial use and do not allow the modification of the source code, while buying a code or an asset usually gives more freedom when modifying the original product always subject to the conditions that they have put, as in everything in this life, there are always exceptions and just as there are softwares that allow you to modify the original source code, there are also assets that do not allow you to modify anything.

### Best free licensing option

One of the best options to license your code or software for free, would be using the Open Source Initiative (OPS) since it is an initiative that promotes the use of open source software, it is a platform where you can share and learn about open source software and with a quality seal, since you can present your own code to be approved and shared on their website to promote your service, they also offer you legal support and tell you how you can license your software well.

![OSI](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5924333?s=280&v=4)

You can also license it yourself with the options I mentioned above, for example using a permissive free license such as the BSD license or the MIT license, if you use the Open Source Initiative, they will most likely advise you to use one of these two mentioned and help you write them, but you can perfectly take one from the internet and modify it to your liking, but if you use a platform like PAHO you can adapt it more and give it more credibility as it is approved by that institution.

## Webgraphy

For this research I've used a lot of webpages as a reference but the most information I've collected are from these ones below:
